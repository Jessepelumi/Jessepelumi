I specialize in building highly scalable and functional applications with a strong focus on user experience. My expertise spans both front-end and back-end development for mobile and web platforms.

I thrive in collaborative environments, having both led and contributed to successful teams.

I'm always looking to expand my network and explore new opportunities for collaboration. Feel free to send me an email or reach out to me on LinkedIn or X.
