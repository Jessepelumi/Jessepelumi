I specialize in building highly scalable and functional applications with a strong focus on user experience. My expertise spans both front-end and back-end development for mobile and web platforms.

I thrive in collaborative environments, having both led and contributed to successful teams.

I'm always looking to expand my network and explore new opportunities for collaboration. Feel free to [e-mail](mailto:jesseoluwapelumi01@gmail.com) me or contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeolad/) or [X](https://x.com/jeolad_?s=09).
