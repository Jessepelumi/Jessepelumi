### Hi ðŸ‘‹ - Welcome to my cove
##### You can call me JEOLAD - It is nothing fancy, it's just a combination of the initials of my name.
##### I am still, daily, figuring this journey out. I love learning and building.
##### I am a software engineer passionate about building (and occasionally designing) user-friendly digital products. I currently specialize in building front-end web applications and mobile applications, focusing on usability and simplicity.
##### In my free time I love to play FIFA, get on the pitch and play football with friends, or sit quietly and create fake scenarios in my head ðŸ˜„ (P.S. I'm not crazy).
##### I have a strong affinity for working in teams, and I believe that I am a good team player. I am always looking for new opportunities to apply my skills and contribute to a team's success.
